# Student Performance Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict students' math scores using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's Student Performance dataset.
Dataset used - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/student-performance-in-mathematics

## Project Overview:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The dataset was explored to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and preprocess the data for model training.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict students' math scores. The models considered include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.

- **Model Selection**: After thorough evaluation, the Linear Regression model was identified as the best performer based on evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

- **Model Deployment**: The selected Linear Regression model was deployed using Azure Web App for seamless integration into production environments.
